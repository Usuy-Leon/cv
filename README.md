This repository hosts my curriculum vitae maintained in plain text (Mar) kdownand rendered to html and pdf using CSS and GitHub Actions.

This project is a fork of [Eliseo Papa's (elipapa) markdown cv repository](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv). Feel free to check the original for updates, as I forked this a while ago so long ago I leave behind a pretty much everything of the original project :).
